# Evilware

Something sinister is afoot within the System and the Administrator entrusted you to stop the Corruption before itâ€™s too late.

Evilware is a classical roguelike made in Godot for the 7DRL 2021 challenge, so be prepared for a lot of dying but hopefully also some re-playable fun.

Commands:

* MOVE: right click where you want to go or use WASD or the arrow keys (also diagonals)
* CRACKING: swap you Cracking skill with E or by clicking the yellow icon and bash the Red Threats by bumping into them. You can purchase more skills at the white Terminals.
* HACKING: swap you Hacking skill with Q or by clicking the green icon. You can purchase more skills at the white Terminals.

Tips and Mechanics:

* Some enemies can corrupt Cells. When they change color you attacks and resistances are lowered.
* Learn to swap and use your Cracking and Hacking skills to deal with multiple enemies. Hacking has a short cooldown. Right click on the icon on the bottom right to display the Skill description.
* At the start, Bits (the currency for purchasing Skills) will be short, but Terminals can always be used to heal to full Integrity.
* Use the Hacking skill "ps" (the magnifying glass) on enemies to get a brief description. Beware, several have some annoying Traits, such as teleporting when damaged or infecting Friendly programs.
